In this exciting time in Alzheimer's and dementia research, scientists continue the momentum necessary to advance new discoveries, even in the face of a global pandemic. As the AAIC 2020 has come to a close, here is just one of the many key takeaways from the conference, as the research community continues to seek treatments, earlier detection and prevention strategies for Alzheimer's and all other dementia. A Blood Test for Alzheimer's On the Horizon Scientists are making great strides toward developing better tests to detect Alzheimer's. This includes advances in blood tests. Here is why it's significant: A simple and accessible test for blood biomarkers may allow for a greater understanding of Alzheimer's in diverse populations, potentially identifying the right people for specific clinical trials. It would also allow researchers to better track the potential therapies being tested, which could help support new drug developments and more treatment options. Last year, AAIC 2019 highlighted blood biomarkers for beta amyloid, a hallmark protein of Alzheimer's that comprises the brain ""plaques"". Research reported at AAIC 2020 focuses on another protein known as tau -- specifically, a form of tau known as p-tau217. Levels of this type of tau in blood may be the most accurate, most specific to Alzheimer's and the earliest way of showing measurable changes to the brain. These new reports are very encouraging, although they need to be verified in larger and more diverse populations. Researchers continue to zero in on tau proteins in the brain and their potential in Alzheimer's and dementia research overall. Visit  to read some of the other exciting research ventures!"

Swab samples added to the lysis buffer are inactivated, making the test safer as well. Our tests should cost less than $15 each, and can be scaled up to 190 samples/run. We are waiting for final supplies (swabs/templates) to complete testing to hopefully get the test out for use within a week.  We will need access to inactivated virus samples to finalize the test, so if you have any connection to a lab that could provide samples or test our system, please reach out or pass this along (info@bioskryb.com).

Despite frustration and hardship, their staff continued to stay positive and motivated. To show the company's gratitude, all employees were paid ""Appreciation pay"" from April into September 2021 - an amazing initiative to acknowledge how difficult the past year has been.  Finally, Gegorgann left us with words of wisdom for fellow retailers who may be struggling to bounce back; ""Don't keep doing things the same way you've always been doing it. Take a critical look at your processes and don't keep doing them just because you always have. Sometimes we keep doing things far longer and generally more complicated than needed. Simplify!"" "

Targeted Public Safety Power Shutoff in small portions of driest locations affecting approximately 5,000 customers in Fresno, Kern, Madera, Mariposa, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Tulare counties.* PG&E crews have begun the process of making repairs and restoring electric service after a powerful windstorm blew through Northern and Central California Tuesday, causing wind hazards and related outages. Weather stations within PG&E's service area recorded wind gusts that neared 100 mph. At the Hell Hole weather station in Placer County, for instance, a 98-mph gust was recorded. In Sonoma County, maximum gusts of 97 and 96 mph were recorded at the Santa Fe Geothermal and Pine Flat Road weather stations. Stations in Contra Costa, Tuolumne, Kern, Santa Clara and Calaveras counties all had gust readings exceeding 80 mph. Since the winds started blowing around 8 p.m. on Monday, approximately 286,000 customers lost power due to the severe weather. As of 4 p.m. Tuesday afternoon, power had been restored to about 208,000 customers with about 78,000 remaining out of power. Multiple PG&E crews are working safely and as quickly as possible to assess damage and restore power. PG&E is moving crews to the most impacted locations and using helicopters to speed up restoration efforts. PG&E has more than 350 electric distribution and transmission crews, 302 electric troublemen and 65 substation switchmen working on repairs and restoration of wind-driven outages. PSPS update Meanwhile, approximately 5,000 customers in the southern portion of PG&E's territory had their power turned off for public safety to prevent potential wildfire ignitions. The shutoffs, which started around midnight Monday, are affecting approximately 5,000 customers in Fresno, Kern, Madera, Mariposa, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Tulare counties. As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, PG&E meteorologists had issued the ""all clear"" for some of the PSPS-affected circuits in Madera, Mariposa, Fresno and Tulare counties. The weather ""all clear"" signal is given once the severe weather subsides and allows electric crews to begin patrolling in the air, in vehicles and on foot nearly all power lines that were de-energized. Once lines are inspected and found free of damage or hazards, PG&E can proceed with restoring power to customers. PG&E is working to restore power to all customers impacted by the PSPS by the end of the day on Wednesday. PG&E has positioned 54 crews to begin patrols once the severe weather passes. Weather permitting, the patrols will utilize up to 12 helicopters. www.pge.com/pspsupdates:=: Supporting customers impacted by PSPS To support customers in the affected areas where a PSPS is happening, PG&E continues to operate Community Resource Centers (CRCs) in seven locations where community members can access resources and keep their families and their communities safe. Further information on the CRCs can be found at www.pge.com/crc.:=: All CRCs will follow important COVID-related health and safety protocols including: - Everyone in a CRC is required to wear facial coverings and maintain a physical distance of at least six feet from those who are not part of the same household. - Everyone entering an indoor CRC will receive a temperature check. - CRC staff are trained in COVID-19 precautions and will regularly sanitize surfaces and use Plexiglass barriers at check-in. - All CRCs will follow county and state requirements regarding COVID-19, including limits on the number of customers permitted indoors at any time."

But, on a Friday afternoon at Centerpoint Medical Center in Independence, Mo., tears of joy were shed during a memorable - and unconventional - wedding celebration for HCA Healthcare patient, Mike McBride, and his bride Melonne. Mike and Melonne had set May 15 as their wedding day and, amidst COVID-19, were planning a quiet ceremony at a church that included only a few family members. But that all changed three weeks ago when Mike, a civilian worker at the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, was struck by a vehicle while he was driving to work early in the morning. Determined to let the couple keep their date, colleagues at the hospital's rehabilitation center sprang into action and surprised them with a wedding cake, punch, decorations and a whole lot of love. Tears began to roll down his cheeks when Mike, who arrived to the outdoor hospital ceremony in a wheelchair, saw his 5-year-old son in attendance. ""It was a special occasion,"" said Dr. Jared Smith, a general surgeon at Centerpoint Medical Center. ""They are such a wonderful family, and Mike has been through so much. This is just perfect.""

We help people understand treatments to improve their quality of life. I grew up in Kerala, nine hours south of Bangalore. We have beautiful green landscapes and lovely beaches. Those are my inspiration to paint, which I've only done for about 3.5 years. I love watercolor for its transparency and ease of use. It is also a difficult medium to master so I found that challenge interesting. My then 5-year-old son asked me to sit and paint along with him. I used to paint in my school days but then left it all. It was enjoyable, but my paintings were horrible. I made up my mind to learn it all again and started watching videos and articles online. I committed to spend at least 30 minutes a day painting as a sort of digital detox. The results were inspiring. COVID-19 played a very important role in helping me get better at painting. Great artists around the world came to the online world with workshops, insights and classes which we could attend from the safety and comfort of our home. These days I spend on average about an hour for my paintings and make sure I paint at least two works a week. I keep it all documented on my Instagram so I can see the progress I have made since I picked up my brush and paints again. Recently, I completed my 400th painting and I am very happy to see I'm getting better every day. It's my yoga. Lilly respects a healthy work-life balance, and recognizes that employees need time for rest and relaxation outside of work. Painting helps me to spend more time at what I love and be fresh at work. Painting has helped me to be more creative at work and when people around you trust and respect each other, it takes work to the 'happy part' of your life.""

Yale University researchers found that the natural immune response to new infection of #Zika virus in individuals already infected with #Dengue virus was not compromised.

Findings can be helpful for the scientific community to understand other emerging #infectiousdiseases including #coronavirus.

501,"We are proud to support the important and life-changing work of Finding Our Voices.  #camdencheer   At the start of COVID, we could no longer tour the Finding Our Voices exhibit of framed photo portraits and audio recordings of 14 women survivors of domestic abuse that launched Valentine's Day 2019 at the Camden Public Library - Camden, Maine, because indoor spaces were closing down. But this outreach was needed more than ever because of how much more dangerous the pandemic was making life for women and children trapped with angry and controlling family members. I had a conversation about this with Greg Dufour, president of Camden National Bank.  I told him my plan to put the exhibit on huge posters for downtown business windows so the messages of hope and help could be broadcast even when domestic violence victims were just driving by on their way to the pharmacy and grocery store. Camden National Bank said YES to our 2' x 4' posters not only in the windows of the Camden bank branch but Greg said he also wanted them in the other Midcoast Maine branches. The chief experience officer Renee Smyth called my cellphone to see how else they could help and Camden National Bank ended up funding-- with the quickest of turnarounds -- a Finding Our Voices domestic violence-SOS mailer that went to every resident of five towns in our county. The next year, 2020, they donated $10,000 to Finding Our Voices to get our survivor-powered posters all around the state, and with that funding and spirit-boost we got 2,000 up in dozens of Maine towns. Last December I had  the idea to get our dating safety outreach into schools, and after a talk with Greg and Renee guess what?  Camden National Bank gave us another $10,000 to sponsor our school outreach for 2022. And look at us now! With the help of an amazing group of FOV-ambassador volunteers including Jennifer Greensmith, Wendy Cook Leeper -- who is now, yay, a board member!!!-- Tracy Lord, Sandy ORourke and spearheaded by our fabulous board member Cathy Stivers our ground-breaking and award-winning outreach is in 140 high schools, with the schools displaying between 10 and 43 of the posters plus distributing bookmarks that are scaled down versions of the posters. All funded by Camden National Bank. This is what community is all about, working together to make Maine an even more beautiful state. And thank you to Keenan Boscoe owner of Topo Gallery in Camden for the poster design!"

660,"Here's some great #MondayMotivation news from us: vaccinations against #COVID19 have been made available for all 2,437 full-time Amgen staff members working at our largest manufacturing facility - Amgen Manufacturing Limited (AML) - in Juncos, Puerto Rico. The on-site vaccination program kicked off on Thursday, March 25, and by noon on Friday, more than 1,000 staff members had received their first dose of the Pfizer injection.  The island of Puerto Rico is a vital manufacturing hub for the supply of biopharmaceutical medicines around the world, which is likely why Puerto Rico's governor, Pedro Pierluisi, established vaccination priority status for residents working in the biopharmaceutical industry. Amgen staff were among those who received priority status from the Puerto Rican government because Amgen makes critical medicines for seriously ill patients around the world. As Amgen's largest manufacturing facility, AML produces a majority of the company's product output, and the site has followed through on its commitment to serve every patient every time, maintaining its production capacity despite the challenges of working during the pandemic. In addition to manufacturing Amgen medicines for critically ill patients, the AML site is also contributing to the pandemic response as a manufacturing partner for Lilly's COVID-19 antibody therapy.

First, he had lunch in the Atacameno community of Peine. There are about 400 people who live in this town in the southern sector of the Salar de Atacama, with whom Albemarle has a cooperation agreement and this year the resources were dedicated to mitigating COVID-19, infrastructure projects and improvements to the water system. Later, he toured the community of Machuca, 50 km (31 miles) from San Pedro de Atacama, where Albemarle has set the tone in the mining industry by signing cooperation, sustainability and mutual benefit agreements with 18 indigenous communities, including the town of Machuca, where a wastewater treatment plant was built in 2020.

907,"It's something that HCA Healthcare charge nurse, Tien Nguyen, never imagined happening to her own family - that her husband and son would both be diagnosed with #COVID19 and hospitalized at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, where she has worked for 25 years. Her 66-year-old husband, Toan, was diagnosed with the virus in early September 2020. He spent a week in the hospital before being discharged. Her son, also named Toan, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on September 16 and admitted to Research Medical Center's ICU on September 19 where he was intubated and placed on a ventilator and heart-lung machine the same day. Unlike his father, the younger Toan's COVID-19 journey has proven to be an uphill battle. His story of survival is fueled in part by his will to live and the expertise of interventional cardiologist Aaron Doonan, M.D., along with hundreds of other caregivers. ""Toan was critically ill but fought the virus with a tremendous desire to live,"" Dr. Doonan said. ""Because of his condition, Toan was put not only a ventilator but also an ECMO, an advanced heart-lung life support machine that pumps blood outside the body to remove carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back to the body, bypassing the lungs and allowing them to rest and heal."" ""I have worked at Research Medical Center for a long time,"" Tien Nguyen says. ""My son is alive because of the knowledge of doctors like Dr. Doonan, Dr. Daniel Balmaceda and Dr. Jonathan Szeto, ICU nurses like Kim Haston and Shelby Duran and many more caregivers, including a team of nurses, support team members, and other physician specialists who gave such compassionate and committed care, treating Toan like he was their own son. I am filled with gratitude."" A socially distanced celebration was held yesterday in honor of Toan's discharge after a four month stay.

She was there 24/7 if we needed her to zoom and 24/7 as a person we could ask questions. As three siblings from different states, we needed the connection with our parents and she made it happen. When our mom passed away suddenly, she got her girls to chip in and made Dad a pillow with our parents' picture on it so Dad could have Mom by him. She embraced us all and loved our family conversations. She loved hearing our family tales and good times! We felt like she was family. Sabrina set up Zoom every other day for us. Sometimes twice in a day. Within 34 days, Dad passed away to be with Mom. It was very hard telling Sabrina that Dad had passed as she had become our other sibling.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans have reported losses of over $38.6 million over fraud related to Covid-19 through May 21st of this year.

Scammers often use promises of refunds and ask victims to click on a text link or press a button to continue on to divulge confidential information. These websites and callers often seem legitimate. Below are some tips to safeguard yourself and your finances against robotexts and robocalls. 1. Block robocalls - Many mobile service providers give their customers the ability to do this for free. 2. Don't respond to unknown text messages or pick up calls from unfamiliar phone numbers.

1152,"Joining Polaris Off-Road in recognizing the first Polaris Salutes American Heroes Winner, Heather Baker. Thank you, Heather!   We've spent June highlighting the inspiring stories submitted for our American Heroes contest. Now it's time to share the winners.  Join Driven with Pat & Nicole in celebrating our first selection, Heather Baker.  Here's Heather's story:  ""Teachers, rather, are often quiet heroes who do not seek recognition but find joy in knowing they've made a difference in a young person's life. They don't receive a celebration parade upon returning home from fighting abroad; they don't stand on a stage to have a medal of valor placed around their neck; and they don't get their picture placed in the local newspaper for their heroic actions. And in fact, we may not even know a teacher was a hero until long after we have left their classroom.   Heather Baker is one of those unsung heroes in the classroom. Like so many of her colleagues, she spends countless hours preparing lesson plans, finding unique ways to connect with her students (and in particular emphasizing technology as a catalyst for development), and truly connecting with each student to make him or her feel special and important.  So when the coronavirus pandemic abruptly and unexpectedly halted teaching in the classroom, she did what every hero does when faced with adversity and a new challenge - adapt and overcome. Heather exceeded requirements established for online learning. She made sure every student still received quality, one-on-one instruction time and attention so that no child was adversely impacted from the pandemic for lack of learning opportunities. In addition to the near daily group video conferencing sessions, she would connect with each student directly either through video conferencing, emails, or live chats. However, the distance learning just wasn't the same and didn't yield the same satisfaction as classroom teaching. The human connection was lost through distance learning.   To overcome this loss of interpersonal connections with her students, she spent many more hours than usual creating fun, interactive videos and other online learning sessions to post for her students to view at their leisure, going above and beyond expectations. But yet, it still wasn't the same as seeing smiling faces at the start of each school day or sharing the elation with a student who grasped a concept they had been struggling with. She yearned for the time when ""normal"" school days would renew. And when the decision was made that in-person attendance at school would not resume for the remainder of the school year, she was truly heartbroken that she would not be able to send off her students into summer with a heartfelt goodbye. She just couldn't let the schoolyear pass without one final goodbye, without one final reassurance to her students that she learned as much from them as they had from her.   Like all other heroes, she wouldn't let unforeseen conditions shape the outcome of this unwelcome news. She reached out to every family whose child was in her class to make arrangements for a socially-distanced visit with each of her students so she could express in person her heartfelt farewell and the impact each student had on her life. In one day she visited over twenty houses and was received at each with a surprised student who was elated to see Mrs. Baker at their home, making one last personal connection with them, delivering words of encouragement and a special gift to brighten their day.   No doubt each student was surprised and elated to see their teacher again, and no doubt that was the highlight of a student's day or even the entire school year. But unquestionably, when these students look back at the year of the pandemic, the year in which school was completed with remote learning away from their classmates, friends, and teacher, at least one will recall with fondness how Mrs. Baker was their hero: someone who transcended the unexpected challenge - not for personal gain or recognition - and someone who has a special place in their heart for the overwhelming kindness, respect, and care their second grade teacher exemplified and bestowed on them during the unprecedented circumstances.""  Thank you, Heather, for being a Polaris American Hero--and thank you to everyone who entered the contest. Tune in all week to see the rest of the winners."

And it took a global pandemic for the world to see it. I recognize that many of you are scared, anxious, and overwhelmed. Yet you continue to come to work every day for our patients and residents, showering them with exceptional care, treating them with unyielding compassion, and providing them with a sense of normalcy when we all know that these times are anything but normal. You have chosen to set your fears aside to take care of a beloved population that is particularly at-risk. Not only are you caring for our patients and residents, but you are standing in for their worried families; you are providing for your own families at home; and you are supporting each other when the days feel unbearably long. This is all in a day's work for our teams, and I extend my deepest and sincerest appreciation to each and every one of you: our healthcare heroes. I am also thankful for the corporate, divisional, and regional staff who have quickly adjusted their own responsibilities to provide meaningful support to those of you on the front lines of this crisis. As you know, the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in this country is real, especially for healthcare organizations. But we have been working around the clock to source supplies for you. In the past three weeks, we've shipped 500,000 protective masks, close to 50,000 pieces of protective eyewear, more than 20,000 protective face shields, and more than 25,000 isolation gowns to Centers. To put these numbers into context, in ""normal"" times, Centers receive about 10% of this volume. The need for protective equipment will grow and we will continue to procure and ship supplies to help keep you safe. We know that we have a long road ahead of us. We also know that thanks to your everyday heroism, we will get through this. With my sincerest admiration and gratitude, George V.

Leeanne is a first-generation Filipina-American. She reflects on the importance of family bonds, how COVID-19 affected the Filipino community and her passion for serving patients through her work for Amgen's Research and Development team. ""My mother arrived as part of the influx of Filipino nurses immigrating to the United States in the 1970s.   Leaving her family and friends to establish a new life - in Michigan, in the dead of winter - was both a sacrifice and privilege. As nurses, my mother, aunties, cousins, and family friends (whom I call auntie/cousin), show the true meaning of strength, courage and compassion. They personify what service to patients really means. COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the Filipino community. Close to one-third of nurses who died of COVID were Filipino - some I knew personally. My mother is an Oncology nurse and is eligible for retirement. In the height of COVID, and with me asking her to retire, she said, ""I can't retire. This is where I am needed."" It was nerve-wracking for all of us who love her but staying where she is needed reflects my mother's values and commitment to her community. These nurses are truly forces of nature - caring for patients, family, and others in need. Like my mother, I am deeply committed to patients. 2021 marks my 15th year at Amgen where I work in R&D Operations focused on external early Discovery Research alliances. I'm inspired by the work and the collaborations between Amgen and scientists around the world. We are unified through the language of science and share a common goal of discovering new medicines to change and save lives. I am happy to be part of the Amgen team, where my voice is welcomed and respected. I am also proud to move through this world as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend and Filipina American. The AAPI community has come so far in its journey here in the U.S. and there's still so much more to do."" #wearebiotech move through this world as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend, a first-generation Filipina American. connect with this world believing that our paths are paved by the support of others and being supportive of others, celebrating the joys of life and finding the grace in failures."""

1430,"From a Silver Spring renter to a Rockville homeowner during a pandemic: This is Tina Yang's Maryland moving story. ___ It was the end of 2019 and Tina Yang -- a 30-year-old health care worker from Silver Spring, Maryland -- began browsing homes online to get a sense of what was out there. Although coronavirus was in the news, it felt far off until Tina's fifth or sixth open house; when she pulled up to tour it, a sign announced that the showing was canceled. Tina quickly set her sights on another home in the same neighborhood. She contacted real estate agent Kathleen Martin through Zillow, and they arranged to tour it the next day. By then, Maryland's governor had declared a state of emergency around COVID-19. Tina and Kathleen toured the house the first day it was listed, but only after Kathleen gave a rundown of the CDC's safety protocol. Keeping their distance, the pair donned gloves -- the CDC had not yet recommended masks -- and waited outside until it was their turn to tour the house alone. Kathleen led the way, wiping down surfaces with Lysol wipes as they moved through the house. Tina bid above the listing price, but lost out to another buyer. Meanwhile, six sisters were helping their mother sell her home in Rockville, Maryland. Tina and Kathleen went to see the house the first day it was listed, walking at a distance and sanitizing as they went. Five days later, the sisters had accepted her offer. ""I prepared her for a socially distant closing where I would not be allowed to attend,'' said Kathleen. ""Fortunately, technology allowed me to give her guidelines on what to expect at closing and provide the important reminders I typically give in person."" Kathleen said she and Tina met only once after the offer was accepted -- for the final walkthrough. Everything else was done through email, text, money wiring and DocuSign. Asked how she felt about her new home, Tina said, ""Now I have a project I can keep improving forever."" Spoken just like a homeowner. ___ As more people move during COVID, we're getting to know the people behind the boxes. For the rest of Tina's story, plus others, head to our resource center: zlw.re/MeetTina:=:"

Cyber Security Tips To Avoid Coronavirus Scams * Don't click on links from sources you don't know. They could download viruses onto your computer or device. * Watch for emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or experts saying that have information about the virus. For the most up-to-date information about the Coronavirus, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). * Ignore online offers for vaccinations. There currently are no vaccines, pills, potions, lotions, lozenges or other prescription or over-the-counter products available to treat or cure Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -- online or in stores. * Do your homework when it comes to donations, whether through charities or crowdfunding sites. Don't let anyone rush you into making a donation. If someone wants donations in cash, by gift card, or by wiring money, don't do it. For more information about scams, visit the Federal Trade Commission website.   The FTC and FDA have jointly issued warning letters to seven sellers of unapproved and misbranded products, claiming they can treat or prevent the Coronavirus. The companies' products include teas, essential oils, and colloidal silver."

1663,"***** UPDATE December 7, 7:15 AM ****** Approximately 8,500 customers who would have been affected by the Public Safety Power Shutoff are receiving notifications this morning that their power won't be turned off Based on more favorable weather conditions, PG&E will be notifying customers this morning (Dec. 7) that it will not be initiating a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) today. PG&E anticipated the need to turn off power overnight to approximately 8,500 customers in portions of Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Tulare and Tuolumne counties. After monitoring weather conditions throughout the night, the company's Emergency Operations Center determined that conditions would not warrant initiating a PSPS. PG&E monitors for the combination of strong winds coupled with dry air and dry fuel conditions when considering whether to call a PSPS. During the overnight hours, winds didn't strengthen in the lower elevations and relative humidity observations did not reach critical values. Ultimately, the decision was made to cancel the PSPS. Customers will receive notifications shortly that their power will not be turned off.  **** UPDATE, December 6, 3 PM **** PG&E May Still Proactively Turn Off Power for Safety in Targeted Portions of Five Counties Beginning Early Monday Morning Due to substantial changes overnight in terms of the severity and location of the strongest winds along with improved humidity, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is significantly reducing the scope of its Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) currently slated to begin early Monday morning. Two days ago, on Friday afternoon, about 132,000 PG&E customers in 15 counties and five tribal communities had been notified of a potential PSPS. Yesterday, that number changed to 92,000 customers. Today, the potential scope of the PSPS has been further reduced to 8,500 customers in five counties: Fresno, Madera (new), Mariposa (new), Tulare and Tuolumne. High fire-risk conditions are expected to arrive later this evening with high winds forecast to continue early Monday morning, peaking in strength during the day Monday, and possibly lingering in some regions through early Tuesday. Once the strong winds subside, PG&E crews will patrol the de-energized lines to ensure they were not damaged during the severe weather. PG&E will safely restore power as quickly as possible, with the goal of restoring most customers within 12 daylight hours, pending weather conditions. At this time, it's anticipated the electric service will be restored to most customers affected by the PSPS by the end of the day on Tuesday. This PSPS is not expected to affect any Bay Area counties. Approximately 2,500 customers in Napa, Lake and Sonoma counties have been removed from the scope of the event. Potential Public Safety Power Shutoff: What Customers Should Know Customer notifications--via text, email and automated phone call--began on Friday, approximately two days prior to the potential shutoff. Additional customer notifications went out on Saturday and today. Customers enrolled in the company's Medical Baseline program who have not verified that they have received these important safety communications will be individually visited by a PG&E employee with a knock on their door when possible. A primary focus will be given to customers who rely on electricity for critical life-sustaining equipment. Although PSPS is an important wildfire safety tool, we know that losing power is disruptive, especially for those with medical needs, customers working from home and students engaging in distance learning in response to COVID-19. The new stay-at-home order, issued on Friday, exempts essential workers in critical infrastructure sectors, including energy; PG&E employees are allowed to continue providing services. Potentially Affected Customers Here is a list of customers by county who could potentially be affected by this PSPS event. -Fresno County: 359 customers, 12 Medical Baseline customers -Madera County: 337 customers, 16 Medical Baseline customers -Mariposa County: 1,234 customers, 18 Medical Baseline customers -Tuolumne County: 6,293 customers, 297 Medical Baseline customers -Tulare County: 225 customers, 3 Medical Baseline customers -Total: 8,448 customers, 346 Medical Baseline Customers Counties No Longer in Scope Alpine County: 574 customers, 7 Medical Baseline customers Amador County: 4,244 customers, 318 Medical Baseline customers Butte County: 8,713 customers, 801 Medical Baseline customers Calaveras County: 10,867 customers, 450 Medical Baseline customers El Dorado County: 28,358 customers, 1,926 Medical Baseline customers Kern County: 5 customers, 0 Medical Baseline customers Lake County: 24 customers, 0 Medical Baseline customers Napa County: 2,378 customers, 104 Medical Baseline (truncated)"

After testing positive for #COVID19, Raul began to feel the physical and mental gravity of the virus. One day during his hospital stay, he looked out the window of his fourth-floor room to see a firetruck and some of his coworkers from the department. His extended fire family had shown up to make sure Raul knew he wasn't fighting COVID-19 alone. They rose the ladder and, one by one, came up to his hospital window to see the 25-year veteran firefighter. ""To see them literally do that and for them to climb all the way to the top of that ladder just to see me, it's hard to explain but it was the most heartwarming experience of my life,"" Raul said. ""It was wonderful. It was amazing."" Raul equally sends gratitude to his care team at Kendall Regional Medical Center. ""They're miracle workers. All the nurses, all the doctors did a great job there. The medications I was on helped tremendously and I owe them my life,"" he says.

1838,"Nancy Rodriguez, 47, lives with to her husband, Julio and works as a housekeeper at NASA. The rest of her family lives in Florida or Puerto Rico, and she had plans to visit them prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In her spare time, Nancy enjoys reading, surfing the internet, watching television and taking care of her two love birds. One day Nancy started experiencing a cough and fever, so she went to urgent care where both she and Julio tested positive for COVID-19. She returned home, but her health continued to decline. Her fever got worse, she lost her appetite and struggled to breath at night. After about a week and not feeling any better, Julio took her to urgent care again. The staff discovered her oxygen levels were alarmingly low, and they told her to go to the hospital immediately. Nancy said, ""If I wouldn't have gone, I wouldn't be here."" Nancy was admitted to Cleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital, where she was diagnosed with COVID pneumonia, put on a ventilator and placed on her stomach, called proning, to improve breathing. She was in the ICU for two weeks. ""I really don't know what happened because I was out of it,"" said Nancy. ""I just remember a nurse holding my hand crying saying 'You will be okay.'"" At one point, doctors weren't sure if she would make it, but Nancy feels someone was looking out for her, saying, ""I closed my eyes and asked God to help me. God was by my side."" With the help of a therapist, she was able to stand up and take a few steps. Her doctors recommended inpatient rehabilitation and suggested Cleveland Clinic Rehabilitation Hospital, Avon. Julio had been a patient there five years prior due to a stroke and had a positive experience, so she knew it was the right place for her to continue her recovery. Nancy said, ""I was waiting for the day I could transfer to Cleveland Clinic Rehabilitation Hospital. I was tired of being in the hospital without walking."" When Nancy arrived for inpatient rehabilitation, she was on supplemental oxygen and still had a feeding tube. She still had issues with breathing, walking and overall strength. Her goal was to get back to talking and walking like she did before her illness. In physical therapy, Nancy focused on starting to walk again. To build strength, she performed leg exercises and used a stationary bike. She also worked with her team on walking with less assistance and going farther distances over time. Nancy recalled a turning point in her recovery, ""There was a day that the doctor saw me walking and he clapped."" That's when she knew she was getting better. Another proud moment was when she was issued a green mobility sign in her room meaning her care team determined it was safe for her to be independent with walking and transfers using a walker. Meanwhile, Nancy's occupational therapists focused on building her upper body strength and helping her become independent for daily living activities. They had her perform exercises to hone balance by reaching for things at a high level, and practice taking showers and getting dressed with increased independence. Speech therapy sessions focused on swallowing and teaching her techniques to improve memory. Therapists had Nancy perform exercises to strengthen the muscles in her mouth and throat. They also taught her techniques to help coordinate breathing while chewing. She started with a soft, bite-sized diet and progressed to a regular diet throughout her stay. Respiratory therapists worked hand-in-hand with the other therapy teams to ensure Nancy had enough oxygen to perform her daily therapy activities. They slowly reduced the size of her trach and eventually helped her wean off oxygen altogether. Nancy felt a lot of support from her therapy teams. ""One of the therapists played music from the 80's, which I love,"" said Nancy. ""They also make you feel encouraged to go on and work hard."" She also spoke about the support she received from family and friends. ""My husband has been there since day one. He helped a lot by taking care of things at home and bringing me clothes, and my friend from work paid me a surprise visit."" After 14 days, Nancy was ready to return home. She was able to walk up to 60 feet without a device, could perform daily living activities independently, was eating a normal diet and off supplemental oxygen. She looked forward to seeing her family and birds again and expressed gratitude for a chance to get back to her life.
